# Problems that Require Arrays

Some problems will be incredibly challenging without arrays, such as the in-class activity from today:


>write a java program that does the following:
display a menu that will have the following options
add employee
average age
employees above certain age
quit
The system can add up to 5 employees. We just care about the ages so you don't need to create a class for them
The system should not allow you to add more than 5 employees
